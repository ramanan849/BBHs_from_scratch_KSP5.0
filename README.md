Hey there! 
This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks and plots for Tasks 0,1,2,3,4 and 5
***
The folders:
1. **Task00** - contains: <br>
  i. the HDF5 files - both the normal COMPAS output and the BSE-Detailed-Evolution output files for ten binaries, starting right from binary 1719569454 to 1719569463. <br>
  ii. graphical representation of the life of binary stars, HR diagrams, Mass vs Time, Stellar Type vs Time and Radius vs Time plots for each of the 10 binaries. <br>
  iii. event-history.txt and event-strings.txt files. <br>

3. **Task1** - contains: <br>
  i. COMPAS output and BSE-Detailed-Evolution files. <br>
  ii. graphical representation of the life of binary stars, HR diagrams, Mass vs Time, Stellar Type vs Time and Radius vs Time plots for each of the 10 binaries. <br>
  
4. **Task2** - contains: <br>
  i. Matplotlib plots generated from [jupyter notebook for task-2](task1,2.ipynb) <br>
  ii. event-history.txt and event-strings.txt and Run_Details files <br>

5. **Task3** - contains: <br>
  i. Matplotlib plots generated from [jupyter notebook for task-2](task3.ipynb) <br>
  ii. RunDetails <br>

6. **Task4** - contains: <br>
  i. Matplotlib plots generated from [jupyter notebook for task-2](task0,4.ipynb) , segregated by BBHs, BHNSs and BNSs.  <br>

7. **Task5** - contains: <br>
  i. Matplotlib plots generated from [jupyter notebook for task-2](task0,4.ipynb) mostly, separate plots for each custom 1 million run and subplots differentiating the LIGO run and a particular run.  <br>

8. **scripts** - contains: <br>
  i. script for generating 100,000 binaries in parallel for task4 <br>
  ii. script for generating 1,000,000 binaries with custom parameters in parallel for task5 and a separate script for combining all the files into one single HDF5 file. <br>
